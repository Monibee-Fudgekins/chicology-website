# Git History Fix Test

This file is created to test if the GitHub Actions workflow now preserves Git history instead of overwriting it with force pushes.

Date: September 10, 2025
Commit: Testing history preservation

## Expected Behavior
- Each deployment should ADD a new commit to chicology-website repo
- Previous commits should remain visible
- The AI system should be able to read commit history for context

## Changes Made
1. Fixed `build_and_publish.yml` to clone target repo instead of force pushing
2. Added commit history functions to Cloudflare Worker
3. Updated AI prompts to include recent commit context
4. Added `/__commit-history` debug endpoint

If you can see this file in the chicology-website repo along with previous commits, the fix worked!
